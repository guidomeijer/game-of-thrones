# Game of Thrones character death prediction
This code uses a publicly available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones) of almost 2000 characters from the books to train a random forest machine learing model to predict whether a character lives or dies. First the model performance is assessed using 5-fold cross validation, it shows a high F1 score (0.85) indicating it can predict well whether a character lives or not based on the data. Subsequently, for a select group of characters, the model is trained on the whole dataset, except for the character in question, to predict whether that character lives or dies.
